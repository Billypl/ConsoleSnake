# Some comments about this project

This is first bigger project I've ever made. I've came back to it after a year (april 2022). When I saw that code, I said to myself "Woah, I wrote that code? Well, time to refactor that spagetti". So that my refactoring journey started. You can see the progress I made in my latest commits, and see the progress I've made in the last year. Clean code and sigle responsibility principle became main factors to look when writing a code, apart from it to work. Let's do the rest :P
